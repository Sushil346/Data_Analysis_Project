# Sea Level Predictor

This project visualizes sea level rise over time using data from the "EPA Sea Level" dataset. It includes two lines of best fit that predict future sea level rise: 
1. A line of best fit that considers the entire dataset.
2. A second line of best fit that considers only data starting from the year 2000.

## Project Overview

The project involves reading a CSV file containing sea level data, generating a scatter plot of the data, and plotting two lines of best fit:
- The first line represents a simple linear regression over the entire dataset.
- The second line uses data from the year 2000 onward to calculate a more recent line of best fit.

The lines of best fit predict sea level rise up to the year 2050.
