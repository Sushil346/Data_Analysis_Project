# Data Analysis & Visualization Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis and visualization projects implemented in Python, as part of the `freeCodeCamp` [ Data Analysis with Python course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-course).

The projects utilize libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy to analyze and visualize various datasets.

## Projects

1. **Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation Calculator**  
   A project to calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a given dataset. This tool can be used to perform basic statistical analysis on numerical data.

2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**  
   An analysis of demographic data to explore the patterns and trends in population statistics, such as age, sex, and other demographic attributes.

3. **Medical Data Visualizer**  
   A visualization tool for medical data, providing insights into the distribution and trends in health-related datasets, helping to identify potential patterns in the data.

4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**  
   A project focused on visualizing time series data related to page views, helping to track and interpret trends in user engagement over time.

5. **Sea Level Predictor**  
   This project visualizes the sea level rise over time using historical data, with predictions for the future based on linear regression models. It predicts sea level rise up to the year 2050.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
- Numpy

## How to Run the Projects

To run the projects locally:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scipy numpy
    ```

3. Run the Python scripts:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

Each project folder contains its own specific `README.md` for more details about that particular project.
